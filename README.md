# Longest adjacent sequence of colors - Python project for uni

Program that finds the longest adjacent sequence of colors in a matrix(2D grid). Colors are represented by
‘R’, ‘G’, ‘B’ characters (respectively Red, Green and Blue).

- Read two whitespace separated 32-bit integers from the provided test case that represents the size (rows and cols) of the matrix.
- Read rows number of newline separated lines of 8-bit characters.
- Program should find and print the longest adjacent sequence (diagonals are not counted as adjacent fields),
and print to the standard output the number.

NOTE: in case of several sequences with the same length – simply print their equal length.
